CarryOn
=======

Why check your gems at /usr/lib when you can pack a CarryOn?

CarryOn is a Ruby on Rails plugin that allows you to install rubygems into your
app's +vendor/+ directory. When your app starts up, gems you installed with
CarryOn will shadow system gems. Gems with C extensions may be compiled for
multiple platforms.


Example
=======

./script/gem install /path/to/your.gem
